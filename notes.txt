people want to control order of status.
people change bug status codes, but instead of deleting old status, just add new ones.

Should a bug's modified change when title or description is changed?

Does PHP/mysql have a stored procedure to automatically update status_last_modified if status changes?

Don't waste effort building a UI for modifying status codes, use phpMyAdmin or a PHP framework.
